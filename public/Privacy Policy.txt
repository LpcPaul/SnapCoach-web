Apple-provided anonymized user ID (to operate your account and protect the Service).

User Content (photos/videos/audio you choose to submit) to provide core features.

Transient technical data (e.g., IP address in transit) solely to route requests and provide security; we do not retain it beyond what’s necessary for the session.
